The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,Sherman Alexie,Young adult fiction,2009,4,209,91,17,14,22,"Good Book
Junior Lives on an Indian Reservation and his family is poor.
Junior was born with water on his brain so e went through surgery at a very young age. He gets made fun of on the Reservation because he has a tiny body and a big head. To cope with the constant struggle of being made fun of he draws and makes comics. He is super smart. He doesn't have many friends just Rowdey, a tough kid who loves conflict. Junior eventually moves to a different school which has never been done on the Reservation.
My favorite part of the book is when he throws his textbook at his teacher and instead of getting mad he came over to his house later and gave him life lessons to use which encourages him to change schools. If you like humor then you would definitely get a kick out of this book.","This book was so good! My son is reading this for his summer reading book for high school so I decided to read it too. Junior's story is sad and heavy, but he describes it in a way that's easy to read and also by adding his own humor and comics, he lightens up the heavy topics that he's dealing with. I can see why this book is always on the summer reading list.","Enjoyed it, very strong and powerful story. Took a very sudden serious turn at the end, but I think it really works for the book, and the writing delivers it perfectly. Very honest, very real storytelling.","Good for Diary style of writing--would have wished for more discussion about what is to be a 21st century Native American--if you are an enrolled member and grew up within your Native community than you are Native--not part-time.
However, it is good thing to support a fellow Native brother who is doing something--we need to support eachother","This review is about The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. Review is important so that the reader knows what you are reading. The readers will let you know what happens in the book.
There are good things about this book. There are so many different things that are sad and things that can be weird. There is an Indian kid that was born with medical problems. He gets picked on by kids at school everyday. This book has many good points.
However, there are some things that can get sad. Arguments were bad, fights were bad, having alcohol in your system were bad, being mean to other kids was bad. Junior getting bullied and being picked on everyday. An Indian girl joins the school and everything changes
.One of the bad things in this book is that he gets picked on even though he doesn't do anything to the others. Other kids calling him names, halloween comes around the corner and the new girl penelope comes and talks to junior. Mary runs away from home.
It's important to read reviews. I would recommend throwing this book in the trash. It's a confusing book to read.","violence, Language, and some sexual content."
Captain Underpants (series) ,Dav Pilkey,Children's literature ,1997,5,32,6,2,2,2,"I would be lying to you if I said I didn't grow up with this series. I never got a chance to read the books because they were released so sporadically, and so, being 30 now and possessing all the means to buy them, I decided to do so. And I always wanted to own the whole series and now I do!

Je regret nothing.

There's a lot of low hanging humor in a book about a man who runs around in his underwear and fights crime, but there are a few actual adult jokes (not adult jokes, but jokes for grown ups). Plus, as the series (and Pilkey's career) progresses, the books become a bit deeper in their messages.

Worth the read. Lots of fun.",N/A,This is an old one and one I remembered reading before. The drawings are funny as well as the humor.

Thirteen Reasons Why,Jay Asher,Young adult fiction,2011,5,2696,602,237,106,159,"In Jay Asher's 13 Reasons Why, he shows the world a side of society that everyone pretty much turns their backs to. This book opened many eyes in the American society because unfortunely people actually go through these things. I would not recommend this book for anyone under the age of 13 and even then it is a little iffy. Some of the elements included are a lot to handle for a young mind that hasnt been exposed to this kind of thing. Readers of a young age should know that the things that take place in this book are not things that will make them cool if they do it.

I fairly enjoyed this piece of writing and as a high school student that wasnt hidden from this stuff i really appriecated it. Enjoy and readers be advised that this is really heavy stuff and that the tv show has changes in it that are not at all in the book.","13 Reasons Why is a book written by Jay Asher and the genre is Teen Drama. People ages 13 and up should read this book. I would rate this book a 4 out of 5. I give this book a 4 out of 5 stars because the book is really good and the only thing I didn't like were some of the characters. 13 Reasons Why is about a teenage girl who leaves behind tapes for her people at her school explaining why she killed herself. Clay, one of the kids at the school, listens to the tapes she leaves behind and listens about all the people who mistreated her. Clay has to deal with a lot of the kids at school being mean to him and bullying him as well. On top of that Clay tried to deal with the sadness of his friend's death. Some people who have depression would probably not enjoy this book because it is really sad and is about suicide. If you are someone who enjoys sad books, then you should read this book because it is filled with dark moments.",It was ok. kind of boring at times. And i just dont understand y the girl was so calm on the tapes. I would have been yelling at tje ppl. And i thonk it was a bit dramatic that she killed herself. She only had one uear left to deal with it and she could have told the police aboit wat some of the pppl were doing bcuz they would have gotten arested,"I would like to say I like this book that our teen was given to read for school,
 but in reading it it caused him to feel it was not something he should be
reading and so I took the book and began to read it, omgosh,
 THIS is not a good book for teens. People can't figure out why kids seek to get
 revenge for someone hurting them in school...this is a story about a teen
who took her life and made tapes that told why and to me at the point of
tape three and this is too graphic for a teen that is sensitive to issues of others...
I just do not think it is what teachers should assign to read!!!!!
Does it have to be assigned due to its content...no!!! So why are our kids
 reading this sort of material?????","It was the most disappointing book I have ever read in my entire life. It received undeserving praise from everyone. So many people recommended it to me and I don't know why. All of these 5 star reviews confuse the heck out of me. I don't think I could even force myself to like this book. As I read, I ended up only turning the pages to get this trash over with. There are so many unlikeable events and characters in this book. First of all, the reasons that Hannah decided to kill herself are so petty and are apparent in every single high schoolers life. Second of all, the people that drove Hannah to kill herself are more likable than her or/and Clay times 1000. The book had so much potential to be amazing. The concept is what drew me and many others into reading this book, and this is the perfect case of a good idea and poor execution. The writing is terrible and leads me to believe that my 9th grade brother could write better than this, and he probably hasn't gotten above a 70 on an essay in his entire life. I have never once written a review on anything, no matter how much I either hated or loved the product, but this book was so bad and disappointing that I just had to make an account and review it. Save your money, and buy something that actually has a purpose."," drugs, alcohol, smoking, being sexually explicit, suicide, and being unsuited for age group"
Looking for Alaska,John Green,Young adult fiction,2005,5,1222,276,108,38,52,"Not only is John Green my favorite author, he rightfully deserves the credit myself and others give him. He is an incredible mind that carefully crafts his books and this is no exception. I hope you consider giving this a read, it could be life changing as many of his books have been for me. Take the chance, if you don't like it lend it to a friend, but trust me... you won't regret it.","It was an endearing book. You liked the narrator, you liked the plot, you liked how he was in search of a ""great perhaps."" I think this book is great if you're a quirky teen. Everyone in this book is a little weird. My reason for not giving this book five stars is Alaska. Such an interesting character with heaps of potential, but no. Green just labeled her a mystery, over-sexualized her like crazy, and wrecked her character. It would have been SO much better if we learned more about Alaska. She wasn't just a pretty face she was her own person, and I get that it might be Green trying to teach us a lesson about all that, but it just felt disappointing. I liked the end though, which was a shock. Endings (especially in YA books) are usually let downs, but Green gave me a good ending with this one. It made me question things and appreciate a little bit of a ""what happened?"" It's nice we don't find out what really happened at the end, it's up for interpretation. But if you're one of those readers that don't like cliffhangers or unanswered questions, this may not be the book for you. Still, I recommend. A good book. Not bad, not great.","Miles, ironically dubbed Pudge by his new boarding school roommate, the Colonel, is a freshman at a small Alabama school, seeking any adventure greater than the bored loneliness of high school and people who never appreciated his quirky love of famous people's last words. When he meets Alaska, the sharp-witted, book-hoarding girl who thinks he’s cute but has a boyfriend, Pudge is challenged to answer an enigmatic question related to Simon Bolivar’s last words about getting out of the Labyrinth of suffering. This question will haunt him the rest of the semester, as he pulls pranks with the Colonel on the dean, smokes his first cigarette, drinks for the first time, tries his first bufriedo, and even gets his first girlfriend. But no one will teach, challenge, or frustrate any of their little group more about trying to understand the labyrinth of life than Alaska, a girl who was allowed to name herself an Inuit word meaning “that which the sea breaks against.”

Looking for Alaska is a wonderful college adventure, filled with first loves, big mistakes, and an unforgettable girl who will break your heart and keep you guessing until the end. Perfect for any John Green fan looking for a tragic-comedy about college life."," think this book was a little shallow in content as well as language. I really wanted to like this book, but I was disappointed with redundancy and lack of depth. It seemed as though I read the same thing on every other other page and I was always left with the question, &amp;quot;So what?&amp;quot; I am sixteen and don't get me wrong, I love a mindless, entertainment-only book, but I found this book both shallow and unentertaining. I also could not connect to any of the characters (despite my similar experiences with the main character) because of the mediocre language. I am most disappointed, however, not with the book itself, but by the fact that it is so popular. Seriously, you can do better.","I'm sorry, but this book was pretty awful. First of all, the writing style is absolutely horrible. It was extremely cheesy and disgusting. The characters are just as bad or even worse. Miles, or ""Pudge"" as his friends call him is a creep and just like every other main character in John Green's books, who falls in love with a girl who drinks, smokes, or both, and is supposedly misunderstood. He does not know how to write realistic female characters. These characters are racist and sexist and overall terrible people, especially Alaska. The whole story was boring, and it felt like there was no actual plot. The only part that seems even mildly interesting was the second half of the story, and even at that it was hard for me to read. In conclusion, please do not waste your time and money on this book.","sexually explicit, smoking, profanity"
George,Alex Gino,"LGBT, children's fiction, transgender",2015,4,12,4,1,0,2,"Alex Gino has written a masterpiece that will pull on very heartstring in their book George about a young trans girl, Melissa, who just wants to play Charlotte in her school’s production of Charlotte’s Web and be seen as who she really is. From page one you can feel Melissa’s deep emotions and her connection to Charlotte is the kind of beautiful relationship to literature that I hope everyone can have. Though this is written for younger audiences (probably in that space after the first chapter books, but before middle grade) it does deal with a lot of delicate topics. For anyone reading this at any age, I do recommend having a solid emotional support system to help process and decompress if need be. Nevertheless, the sensitive way Gino talks about Melissa’s struggles and dysphoria make this a crucial read for children and adults alike.","While this is intended for a younger audience than what I typically read, I really liked it a lot. I think it is a very important book, and it has the potential to make a difference in the lives of young children who are struggling with their identities. It also promotes a strong message of acceptance throughout, which can develop empathy in children who may not be struggling with identity, but may know those who are. It was a quick read and I enjoyed the story, and how realistic the reactions of people seemed.",N/A,N/A,"Right off the bat, this book is clearly geared towards a very young audience. I personally feel it would be a better and more affective book if it was for for teens and adults. Even if the vocabulary and writing style are simplier (at about a third grade reading level), it is still terribly written.

This book opens children up to the different kinds of families out there without being offensive and in your face about it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has children, and wants to teach them about equality and acceptance.","This is a very simple book. The illustrations and writing are good but not great. But I can appreciate its simple story of two male penguins in love. For those who don't agree with homosexuality, don't read the book. But saying it is inappropriate for children is unfair. There is nothing detailed or offense in it. If you don't share the views, don't read it. That would be like me telling you not to read the Bible to your kids because I don't believe in it.

this is a really good book.
-to be 8th grader(3 more months)","A nice, sweet read for middle school readers. As a theatre kid, I know all too well about the trials of putting on a performance, making sure everything works that and pray that nothing goes wrong during hell week or, heaven forbid, a show. It's cool that this is rather a look from a techie's point of view rather than someone who has a leading role. It may show kids interested in theatre that, even if you can't sing or act, you can still be a part of a performance.

I also like how these kids deals with relationships. Since they're all still pretty young, 12 or 13, they're still trying to figure things out. No one really ends this story with a stable and understanding relationship and, since they're kids, it's pretty understandable. And yes, this book does get points for showing more than just straight relationships.

While I was pretty positive about this book, I didn't feel like it was the greatest thing I've ever read. It's adequate and, judging by how often it gets checked out at my library, kids definitely love it.",it was ok the book lacked of detail. and you really had to pay attention to the pictures in the background to understand the book.,"I would give this a zero if available. Some else had my child out shopping, I would have never let her purchase this book because of its content. This author misused the trust that some parents apparently have or had in her, after she had written more innocent books. This book claims its written at a 4th grade reading level but is really at a 2.3 level, according to ARBookfinder. Middle school issues for 2nd graders? My child, at a (2.5 year level) easily read almost the whole book before asking me ""Mommy what does this mean?""

Fifty Shades of Grey,E. L. James,Erotic romance novel,2011,4,7223,2019,1259,658,1546,"This was the first book I ever read in the Romance genre. I know there have been mixed reviews on this story, but I loved it. Maybe having my introduction to romance being BDSM probably was not the best idea but it got me hooked. While the writing has been criticized a lot, I have to say I was addicted to the story from the moment I started it.

Ana was so oblivious in the beginning thinking he was just this hot billionaire who wanted to date her. She had no idea what she was getting herself into. She thought she was Cinderella being taken back to his house on a helicopter but no matter how hot or rich the guy was the moment he showed me the Red Room I probably would have ran for my life. Well, maybe.

I loved that we did not get to see Christian’s POV. By doing that I felt like I was going on the ride with Ana too. I felt all the emotions and was anxious because we had no idea how he really felt about her. Every girl hopes that she is going to be the one who can make a guy change his ways. Their relationship had us on a rollercoaster of emotions. Be prepared for a cliffhanger and just be glad you do not have to wait for the second book.","Easy To Read.

I also like the that literature is an intrinsic part of the novel. Hopefully the next two are better though.",It was interesting enough for me to finish the book but it wasn't all that great. I didn't even want to read the second. It took me about a year until I finally decided to read it.

Internet Girls (series),Lauren Myracle,young adult novel series,2005,4,2,1,1,0,0,Read this before and had to read it again loved it,"I remember seeing this book in the bookstore when it first came out, but I never read it. After reading the book Upside Down Magic, which is coauthored by Lauren Myracle, I decided to give this series a try. Since I knew this book was published 14 years ago, I was shocked at all of the current references. The girls watched Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy. These references actually really confused me at first, until I read that it was actually an updated version if the book with current popular culture references! This makes the book relevant for today’s teens. I really enjoyed this story. It is told in a unique format, because it is only told through texts between three friends. They have to summarize some things they do outside of the texts so the reader knows what’s happening. The subject matter of the story was very serious at times. One of the girls has an inappropriate relationship with a teacher while another is bullied once an explicit video is posted online. These are realistic issues that can come up in any high school. This is a great book! I’m looking forward to the rest of the series.",Kiss you hand three times then post this for three other books then look under your pillow,N/A,N/A,offensive language and sexually explicit content
The Bluest Eye,Toni Morrison,African-American literature,1970,4,99,55,35,11,14,"I struggled with this book. The book opens as if reading an old Dick and Jane story, you know, the ones that many of us learned how to read in the first grade with those repetitive sing-song sentences of an idyllic family. A white family. The Bluest Eye is starkly written and at times difficult to grasp because of the vernacular used by Toni Morrison depicting the time in which story takes place. Once I adjusted to this seemingly awkward flow, I was drawn into the story...I was committed.

The story takes place in 1941 and is about a little girl named Pecola and is told through the eyes of another girl, Claudia, many years later. Claudia begins the story in the middle and goes backwards...way backwards to the two who gave Pecola life. This time line isn’t an easy one to write nor read; but Morrison pulled it off. This back story, much like a tragic Shakespearen play, had the same horrific feel, consequences and demons. It’s about oppression of woman in every sense of the word.

This book may not be for everyone. The Bluest Eye is not a fast read, nor should it be. It will grab your brain and squeeze your heart. It will make you uncomfortable. It will make you close the book and put it down many times. It will also make you pick it back up and read until the very last page bringing you back to the first page, full circle. It will make you think and perhaps, validate.","I read this novel to fill a gap in my literary history. Despite having read many of Morrison’s novels, I had never read this one—her first. Although it does not display the artistry and insight that her later novels would (*Beloved* remains my all-time favorite of her novels as well as one of my all-time favorites overall), the risks she takes here with narrative perspective, voice, imagery, and taboo subject matter (such as rape and incest) reveal the imminent magnificence that would later earn her the Nobel Prize.","The varying perspectives were interesting; although, reading from the point of view of a child molester was disturbing. I am not sure why this frequently appears on high school reading lists, for it is a mature read. If a reader enjoys this novel, I suggest the powerful Beloved: reading it haunted me for a long time.","I wouldn’t recommend The Bluest Eye to just anyone. The book does an amazing job of talking about racism and beauty standards which still resonates with people today, however, the book does a poor job of advertising to a target audience and normalizes violence. The summary of the books defines what beauty means to Pecola and immediately introduces racism as a front and center topic. Beyond that, it uses vague language like “adversity” on the back synopsis which does little to suggest she’s raped. On top of this, on page 162 &163 the violence she suffers is told from the perspective of her rapist and steals her innocence by distorting her into something she isn’t. Violence is again normalized when Pecola’s mother discusses her love life with her husband on page 131. What she has isn’t love, and may even be rape but she denies the possibility of rape because she’s married. Additionally, the powerful themes tying into racism and beauty standards are told from the perspective of children which would suggest the book should connect to a younger audience-highschool students. The main character telling the tale even acknowledges she doesn’t comprehend what the adults are saying on page 15, so how should the audience towards which it is presumably directed grasp the novel? With so many mixed messages the book should be directed towards an audience who is already educated about all of the topics mentioned, and okay with discussing violence.","I must say I did not enjoy this book at all. Hard to follow at times, very depressing, and a very sad ending- I kept hoping that somehow, and, in some way, this little girl would come away a success- (I was ""rooting"" for her through-out the entire novel)- Perhaps, with the aid of a mentor, an education, a miracle, or, better yet, all three! Poor little girl-A life worth living in return for all that she had to go through, was what I was hoping for- Unfortunately, this novel never gave her a chance- In addition, this novel is filled with verbal pictorials and jumps from one character development or background to another- definitely, not straight forward- the story goes on and on and does not get to the point- Saddest part of it all, it is a copulation of various and varying vignettes depict yet another depressing episode of this little girl's life and family- If this is the type of books you may enjoy, by all means read on- I walked away after reading this novel asking myself what on earth did I get from reading such a bleak and dark account?
