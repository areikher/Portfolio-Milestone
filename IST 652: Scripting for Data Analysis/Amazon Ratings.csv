I originally started reading the book because a local school board had decided that it was inappropriate (apparently they think 9th graders can't handle mildly off color words) and want to ban it. The board president and other conservative members of the board hadn't even read the book but were basing their opinion on a blurb they read. They'd been given months to review it and despite it being a very quick read, they chose to not make the effort.

I was hooked immediately. The author made you feel like you were part of his world even though most us have never been closer to a reservation than seeing advertising for a casino on TV. I recommend this book to anyone with teenagers. They would benefit from seeing the perspective of someone they might not encounter in their everyday life and maybe reevaluate how they treat people from other cultures.","Illustrated strory of living between 2 worlds
It was sometimes funny and sometimes heartbreaking to read about a young man navigating between his life on the reservation and life in the White world just out side the reservation. The basketball game represented so much.

I enjoyed the illustrations on notebook paper taped into the book. The one that stands out the most to me is what his parents would look like if they had been able to live out their dreams."," Caution: adolescent juvenile content and foul language included.
Great plot line. Did not expect as much cursing or talk of male self-pleasuring as what occurred. Not sure that it really contributed or was necessary to the overall theme of the story. My 12 yr old and I read it over the summer while we were together. It captured my attention with the potential themes of handling being a minority or not being considered part of the ""in"" crowd in a middle school setting; some of the most challenging years of a young adult's life. In short--enjoyed the overall plot; could have done without the cursing and sexual content.",Was not an enjoyable book. He just rambled on not making any sense of what he was trying to convey. I would not have read this book except for it being our book club selection for the month. Not worth the money.,"Inappropriate Sexual Themes throughout Book

My daughter had this book as an option to read for a middle school class. I was shocked after reading reviews that the content would be so inappropriate. I ordered the book to do my own research. This book is full of inappropriate paragraphs and references to masturbation, pornography, and boners. Then these same themes continue throughout the book. I am sure there would be many other appropriate books to teach kids what life is like growing up on a reservation or as a Native American. Any aspects of the cultural lessons of this book are overshadowed by the violent and vile sexual tones.","violence, Language, and some sexual content."
Captain Underpants (book 1) ,Dav Pilkey,Children's literature ,1997,4.8,2902,330,123,33,63,"Around when I was in third grade and all the other kids were reading these books, I was very hesitant to read these books and didn't want anything to do with them. About four years later I saw the first trailer for the Captain Underpants movie and didn't think it would really be worth seeing. A few months later I started watching the trailer nonstop and searched YouTube for every possible scene in the movie. A couple of days later I decided that before I saw the movie itself that I should read as many of the books I could so that I wouldn't have to handle the wait much longer. Ten minutes later I finished the first epic novel.
I bet you're wondering why my opinion on these novels changed so suddenly. You see, once I saw a trailer for the movie saying that the critics thought it was heartwarming, far more emotional then you'd ever believe, and about the power of friendship and imagination, I immediately fell in love with it. I became absolutely hypnotized by every trailer I saw on TV just like how Mr. Krupp became hypnotized by George's and Harold's ring. I then saw that it got 85% by Rotten Tomatoes and was astonished.
The main reason why I fell in love with this franchise in the first place was because I thought it could possibly teach me something about friendship and what it means to truly have a best friend at your side at all times, since I didn't currently have a best friend at my side at all times like everyone else in school did.
When I first read this book, I couldn't stop smiling at how close George and Harold seemed to be and just how clever they were with all their pranks. Overall, I don't think I'll ever stop reading these books anytime soon and that I'd recommend it to every child out there and not just the ones in the lower grades. I mean, I was thirteen when I first started reading these books and I'm even a girl! Also, whatever you do, don't be hesitant to read these books no matter how many there are! Trust me, you'll be surprised and humored by what you read in these novels.","This story is very relatable for young children in that it features two best friends who have created their own stories in the form of a comic book. It is also holds entertainment value: these two young boys are constantly getting into trouble with the principal. The story follows the crazy adventure of the boys and their principal and their creation of Captain Underpants, with the help of a cereal box prize.
As a mother of a little boy in elementary school, this book came recommended as a high-interest read. We sat down together to read a chapter or two, and ended up reading the entire book in one day! There are several “interactive pages” where the reader can flip the pages back and forth to recreate a scene from the book, which is very entertaining and fun, although may leave several pages of the book in tatters. The content is very elementary with potty-humor and plenty of fun-poking at authority figures. While I’m not a fan of gross-out bathroom humor, my son was constantly in hysterics. The illustrations are ones that could have been drawn by little boys, which draws the young audience in even more. The idea of a comic book written by two kids enticed my son to write his own comic book featuring his little brother. If you have young boys in your life, they will enjoy these books. Be warned, this book is the first in a huge series, so you may be committing to several years of toilet humor and fun!","Not sure what to say...As a 74 yr. old previewing this book before giving it as a gift I must admit I was amused. I think it is the first in the series and would be interested in the second one to change my feelings. What did I come away with? If anything, improper school behavior by the boys. Disturbing school principal behavior. In the end the kids took pity on him and tried to help. Hopefully neither emulate these outlandish behaviors in ""real life"". The question is will a six year old recognize ""outlandish behavior""? I think you have to evaluate/know your recipient to answer that question."," I see why children love these books.
This is definitely a book for kids. I see why this book is constantly on the censored list each year, though there is nothing wrong, except it might make kids to act out and be class clowns, or to show kids they can be creative and artistic."," A McDonald's kid's meal for the child's mind
I feel upset and angry that this junk gets promoted everywhere: zero educational value, zero literary value. My child's teacher concurs with that assessment and would not recommend this to any of her students. Why then Mr. Pilkey's books are being so aggressively pushed everywhere, including school book fairs? I guess he has an agent with deep pockets. Please spare your child this garbage, if you aspire for them to develop a taste for real literature some day and not be stuck reading comic books and junk all their lives.","Offensive Language, Partial Nudity, Violence, Misbehavior, Blackmail/Threats, Racism(?)"
Thirteen Reasons Why,Jay Asher,Young adult fiction,2011,4.5,8520,1916,938,392,491,"This was a reread for me and I'm so glad I dived back in it. I first fell in love with this story in high school. For the longest time it was the only representation I had for mental illness, I connected with a dead girl because she had so many emotions I also shared sometimes to my own fright. Hannah's story is tragic and heartbreaking. The ending always shook me because she wasn't coming back, you had such a strong narrator for these tragedies but she wasn't going to get up and say ha! It's all a joke. She was gone, and that is one of the reasons I always came back to this book. I needed to know she was gone, that is the outcome of suicide that I didn't want to see at 17, your story is finished. Now as an adult reading it, it's still heartbreaking and terribly tragic and I still connect so strongly to this story. I loved this book and will always love this book. I read more into it now than what I did then. Clay was the perfect perspective to put it in because I can't think good things about any of the other characters, as hard as the tv show wants you too. The tv show has recently released on Netflix and they've changed so much from the original book and part of me wonders is if it's to make it make more sense. The thing is, suicide doesn't make sense. That tragic act doesn't have to make sense. It's sad and scary, and we will ever understand even with 13 separate and valid reasons, it still doesn't make sense. One this book did such a good job of showing is how small things, things we think inconsequential, can be detrimental to someone else. Something as simple as not saying goodbye given the opportunity, can change how someone feels. Now does this mean we have to walk on egg shells? No, that actually impossible. It means watch what your doing basically. If your having a bad day it isn't okay to take it out on someone else, we can control the small things so the big things won't spiral. This book will always hold a special place in my heart, and I'm sure once the shock of the show wears off it will too. I needed to reread this book, it's good to remember what we do and who we are matters. Even when you think you don't matter and no one would care, you do matter. You matter so much! ❤️","Powerful! This book was a ""must read"" recommendation from a friend. There should be more awareness regarding suicide among young teens and adults, but I was somewhat disappointed in this approach. Told through the thoughts of a teen boy as he listens to tapes of a young girl's 13 reasons for taking her life, I had a bit of difficulty switching back and forth between Clay's thoughts and Hannah's dictation on the tapes. Clay's sensitivity and responses to the tapes are heartrending.

The writing was well done, with excellent insight into the subject matter. From what I understand some of the schools are utilizing the book to educate students regarding suicide. It relays the serious ramifications of what peer pressure imposes on others. The premise for this book is appropriate for teens, and it may assist in bringing to light the seriousness of the actions and reactions that lie beneath the surface of a youngster's psyche. Portions of the book brought me to tears.

It's definitely worth the read. Parents could benefit from reading this book for it's raw honesty regarding what we may consider the ""little"" things in life. Those ""little"" things are ""big"" things for our children. If reading this book could save even one life it's worth taking the time to read it.","I remember reading the beginning in middle school and could not get into it. I actually finished it this time and did not enjoy it. not to say it means nothing but the character and her ""struggles"" were not really relate-able to me and did not seem like any real struggle had happened to her. if she walked in my shoes or any of my friends shoes she would have offed herself way sooner and im not saying i have lived through all these tragedies but this character was nothing i could relate to and felt like it was all predictable like some cheesy disney/lifetime skit or something. it was exaggerated to me and over hyped but i am glad that it has helped make mental illness more public. I was inpatient and out patient for several months in two different wards and there definitely is a stigma that comes with anything related to mental illness and im glad this book has helped others.","The one thing I like about this story is the conclusion we all need to make a conscious effort to be kind to one another. What I didn’t like was “13 reasons” felt to me like revenge, which is also unkindness. As a teen, I lost a friend to suicide. Another friend attempted suicide. A third friend destroyed himself with drugs. What each of these needed was a good friend and enough inner strength to consider the source when dealing with peer oppression and opinion. Thankfully, I had the opportunity to be a good friend, despite the rumors that friendship caused. And, I did consider the source of those unkind words. I grew stronger because of that season of my life.","Terrible message. This book chronicles all the people who were mean to a girl before she commits suicide. The message is that OTHER people are responsible for how you feel and the actions you take. I do not recommend this book for teens or young adults, except as an example of how NOT to be."," drugs, alcohol, smoking, being sexually explicit, suicide, and being unsuited for age group"
Looking for Alaska,John Green,Young adult fiction,2005,4.6,9709,2332,1004,357,341,"I got this book because I'd read Green's other books. I love that he creates interesting, strong, female characters. I knew nothing of it's plot or tone or anything. I entered the labyrinth unencumbered with expectation. At first, I was thinking, oh Lord, a depressed lonely kid, and an angry roommate (I pictured the Colonel as Sean Austin.) But, deeper into the labyrinth I went on my quest to see what was the point of this story. The big event was a surprise. I, too, was desperate to know the answers to the W questions. So much so, I devoured the book in one sitting. Actually didn't go to work (I wasn't required to go in, but seeing as my workload has just increased, probably should have...ah those tiny decisions...) because I was invested in knowing. It's a fault of mine. I hate not knowing when I could know. And, it was totally worth it.","I read this first in college for a young adult literature class, got through the rest of college, started working, and in the process of all of that in-between stuff, I forgot about this lovely book. I remember liking the book, but not much else. I don't know if I just got busy or if I was too involved in myself or what. Either way, I'm glad I reread it.

A young adult novel about life and death and moving on doesn't sound all that original at first, but Green's treatment of adolescents is different. He makes his characters complex and intelligent and impulsive as every teenager truly is. He does not treat his characters as they might treat themselves, over-important or that which should be pitied. Nor does he treat them as so many adults might, with disdain for their rashness and lack of experience. The author makes his story accessible and realistic to teens and adults alike because there seems to be truth in the conflicting emotions his characters go through.

Mildly pornographic. MILDLY. Just tasteful enough for adolescents learning that sex is confusing and funny and kinda great but really just mostly confusing at first.

I'm glad the answers aren't given in this book. It's about learning how to move on when there aren't definite answers, when there is doubt. This book is about figuring out some things on your own and doing the best you can with what you've got. It helps to forgive and to empathize and to search, but keep going all the while, day by day.","I bought this for my nephew last Christmas. He never opened it, so I decided to try to read it to see what kids are up to these days. Sheesh!! It is full of profanity. First of all, I think a book can be written without profanity. I think it was thrown in just to increase the word count. The drinking, smoking, sex, and general all around bad behavior was a turn off. I don't want my nephew to read this. I want to try to plow through the rest of it to see what the point of it is, but I don't know if i can or not.","Ok, I Found Alaska, Now I Wish I Hadn't
I'm not gonna lie. I was disappointed in this book. I read The Fault in our Stars and enjoyed it a lot. I love John Green's writing style, and in general, I think he is a great person. But Looking for Alaska was bad. NONE of the characters were likable, not even Alaska. I am actually surprised that I read through it in a few weeks. The Before part of the book kept my curiosity up because I wanted to know what was going to happen to Alaska. And finding out what happened to her, I think this book was poorly titled. They weren't looking for her. They know what happens to her.

But the unlikable characters, and the depressing end for Alaska is what did it for me. That is why I didn't like the book. Miles (Pudge), Chip (The Colonel), Takumi, and Alaska were not enjoyable characters, so it made it hard for me to empathize with them. I didn't expect them to be perfect, but they were mostly jerks more than anything. The only one that I remotely liked was Lara, the girl from Romania. The smoking didn't bother me. The drinking only bothered me when they got drunk enough to act stupid. But overall, I wouldn't recommend this book. But I still love John Green's writing,","I usually enjoy reading John Green. I am sad to say, I couldn't make it through this book. There was too much of under aged drinking,cigarett smoking, f-bombs, and kids being jerks. I found non of the characters to be likeable. The main character had a romantic longing for this girl named Alaska. I didn't get why because she was mean,moody,and vengeful. Anyway,Maybe the main character came around to be a better person,but I didn't stick around for it.","sexually explicit, smoking, profanity"
George,Alex Gino,"LGBT, children's fiction, transgender",2015,4.7,1040,154,47,23,41,"This book was recently denounced by the ""Million Moms,"" one of those self-appointed guardians of public morality. So naturally I had to buy a copy to see what the fuss was about. It's the story of a ten-year-old girl named Melissa who is faced with a problem. The problem is that most of the people she knows consider her to be a boy named George. Of course, complications ensue, and the book is about how she faces this situation and how the problems start fo get resolved. As a 77-year-old firmly cisgender male, I'm not exactly in the target demographic for this, but found it a fascinating story, and one which would be especially interesting and empowering for a ten-year-old, whether transgender, questioning, or just interested in gender issues. I wish there had been books like this whan I was a kid,","I loved the strong voice of the narrator and how easy it was to feel her frustration and confusion. It gave a strong sense of what transgender is and feels like. The story at times was unrealistic, which takes away from the focus of the story. A thoroughly enjoyable read for such a sensitive topic.","I initially picked up this book after seeing it on ALA's Most Banned Books list for 2018. I really enjoyed the story and, being a straight girl who loves being a girl, I couldn't imagine what a young trans person went through. This book puts you in George's place and what she went through to hide who she initially was, how she came out to her parent, and how a supportive friend can make a world of difference. This book should not be on any banned list; it should be read by all.","This book is being sold as an elementary book. I really think it is more appropriate for the middle school age range. The children while written as 4th graders, act more like 6th/7th graders. I wish it had been written at a reading level appropriate for the kids who could really learn from it. I have kids of these ages, and this is not a book I would read to my 3-4th grader.","The story was rather boring and not exceptionally well written. I was disappointed that in the book, George is 100% sure she's a girl (at 9/10 years old) and that the book ignores the anxiety and uncertainty that surround figuring this out. It would've been much more interesting and possibly helpful for kids if George had been figuring out how to deal with figuring out what these feelings are rather than the 100% focus on ""telling everyone I'm a girl."" I also think this book would be more appropriate for middle school aged kids as it references ""porn,"" ""hiding your search history from mom,"" ""all boy are dirty and look up girl's skirts"" and ""dirty magazines. Not what I want my son's reading in the 3rd and 5th grade (as Oregon's Battle of the book is slated for). I wanted to like this book, but it didnt delve into anything that could have really helped kids and it had too many inappropriate references for under 7th grade kids. The only upside I found was that it prompted me to have a good convo with my kids and talk about how sad it would be to carry around a secret and not be able to share the burden with mom and dad and that I hope they can always share anything with us.",sexual references and language considered to be inappropriate for children
And Tango Makes Three,Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell,Children's literature,2005,4.9,1811,120,27,6,56,"My husband and I bought this for our daughter (4 1/2) for Christmas and it was the first thing she wanted to read Christmas night at bedtime. We both absolutely loved it. She was riveted from page one, and totally amazed that it was about real penguins. She immediately told Grandma all about the next morning. It is just the sweetest, loveliest story. So glad we bought this, and I can't wait to listen to Neal Patrick Harris on the CD!","A cute story to introduce different types of families to your little one. I bought this to read to my toddler, he doesn't really have the patience to sit for it. Hopefully he'll sit better for stories as he gets closer to the recommended age. My deduction of a star is for the quality of the board book. The pages are much thinner and less sturdy than board books usually are, and I don't know how it'll hold up to my toddler's destructive tendencies.","Just got around to this story - I've heard about this book being banned for some years now - what nonsense. It's a book about two male chinstrap penguins raising a chick, with the outside assistance of the human zookeeper. The zookeeper gives them an egg to rear after observing the animals trying to care for a rock.

This ""children's"" book has nothing to do with sexuality, and everything to do with companionship and adding to an extra beak to a penguin family. If you see 2 chinstrap penguins it would be difficult to tell male from female. So this story has 2 male penguins rearing a penguin chick, instead of female/male. Both males try to incubate a rock. Bless the real life zookeeper for noticing their dilemma.

For some people to take this story so figuratively that implies homosexuality, is truly a joke. Every animal needs love, these penguins are just one example.","If you want to indocrinate your children with the message of ""tolerance"" (i.e., nothing is wrong or immoral), then this is the book for you. If you instead love all types of people but do not accept that everything they do is perfect, then this book is NOT for you. The gay overtones in this book are quite heavy, especially when the author writes that the two male penguins ""must be in love.""

This book presents homosexual relationships as healthy and a good environment for rearing children - it's dangerous to indoctrinate your kids with these false notions. Tolerance is good and it is a virtue, but acceptance is not. I can tolerate immoral behavior, but I don't have to accept it, and this book overtly and needlessly glorifies the idea of homosexuality.

Since the book was written, the penguin couple has split-up; Silo left his male companion for Scrappy, a female penguin. This too tests our acceptance and is a testimony to diversity. Will there be a follow-up book?","This is a story about homosexual penguins. There is very little information about this book dealing with sexuality until you start reading it. If I buy a book to help teach my children about becoming potty trained, that’s very evident in the title and cover imagery. If I buy a book to teach about the religious significance of Noah’s ark, that’s very evident in the title of the book and cover imagery… But this book purposely hides its controversial subject matter. It’s a free country, and you can teach your kids whatever you want, but it’s not appropriate to manipulate parents of toddlers, through an inviting title and kid friendly cover imagery, to teach an opinion of sexuality.","“unsuitable for young children” and has ""homosexual overtones"

Thanks to them I immediately purchased this book for my 2nd grader so that she does not grow up to be someone who is freaked out or disgusted by such things. I told my daughter that some parents thought that a book about two boys or two girls liking each other and dating was inappropriate for someone her age. She said, “that’s ridiculous!” I agree.","I am 12 years old, and a sixth grade girl. Many of the comments below state that this book is inappropriate for girls and boys my age because of the gay actions that happen during this book. They also state that it's somehow scary in the same way. But I truly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to kids my age, and younger, and older, and adults and beyond. I really enjoyed this book. I gave it a four-star because it's not my favorite of Telgemeier's works, but I still enjoyed it. I would recommend all the books that I have read by this author including Drama, Smile, and Sisters, (the sequel to Smile). I would highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a well - written, easy - read book. (It's also very good for all theatre rats such as myself.) I hope that everyone can take away from this book and Telgemeier's others as much as I did!","I’m glad that society is opening up about sexual orientation etc.; however, I would have appreciated if the synopsis had included mentioning of this content, since I do not have the time to pre-screen everything. I leisurely asked my kid how he liked this book and what it is about. He said “good. It’s about this gay kid who dates other boys.” And while this really is not what the book is about, this is what he picked out as most memorable. I wish I could have given the book to him at age 12 or 13, when I feel the content is more developmentally appropriate, (dating, gender identity, and all) or at least read it WITH him to assist his thought process.

Fifty Shades of Grey,E. L. James,Erotic romance novel,2011,4,30221,6191,5451,4246,10861,"This is the third time I've read this; each time I realize something new that was missed. The story is emotionally intense with two people from different social economic backgrounds. Christian Grey is young mega millionaire in the high tech world of Seattle, WA. Anastasia Steele is a student at WSU who is helping her sick college roommate Kate. Ana agreed to take Kate's place to interview Christian Grey. This starts a relationship that thrusts Ana into a world she never knew existed but also opens Christian up to feelings that he had a head time recognizing. Ana learns of his difficult early childhood also of his current secret security. Read this with an open mind; the love story is a what I saw. Diamondgirl","Okay. To begin with, if you are wondering if this is an x-rated book, yes it is. It is FULL of sex. Like every single chapter. Many times in a single chapter. So if you are looking for a ""thrill"" I guess you will find it here. I will be honest however, and say that after a while you're like, ugh, give it a rest already! Yes, there is such a thing as TOO much sex! Lord have mercy, I get that the whole premise of the book is sex and desire and BDSM, but it gets a little annoying after a while. I will say that in my opinion, I think the book is well written. I don't really understand some of the criticism that it isn't. I liked the writing, I loved the story and was eager to read more. As I mentioned, the sex got in the way a lot, I got tired of seeing which different ways Christian could do the deed with whatever tie, bindings, cuffs, whatever he had in mind. I wanted the story to keep going. It does, just with constant sex. As far as the characters go. Hmm. While I think the guy who played Christian in the movie is drop dead gorgeous (not crazy about his American accent though, too heavy) I did NOT like Christian as a character. When he does have sex with Ana he basically rapes her every time, (he calls it ""rough"" , no it's rape!) I think he's cold and cruel, even further along in the books he is jerk. He's mean to Ana and to Kate and all their other friends. Okay I get that he was abused as a child and all that, but seriously, what woman would put up with this crap? I know that Ana was supposedly an innocent, a virgin with no experience and young. But her willingness to let him get away with all the crap he pulls drove me nuts! If that had been me I would have told him to stick it, but then I think I'm a more aggressive person than she is apparently. I think Christian is allowed to get away with too much without being held accountable. I kept hoping his family would discover his Red Room of Pain. That would have been interesting. So no fan of the characters really (seriously Ana grow a back bone!) but the overall story was interesting...except for where it wasn't believable. So here's Ana: dowdy, plain little Ana, no experience with men, but this male model type billionnaire is supposed to be super attracted and obsessed with her? That would never happen in real life! Anddddd, what normal woman, would hear all the BDSM crap and see the room and hear all of Grey's twisted ideas and not run for the hills? Again, it would never happen! I think Ana must have been seriously flawed herself to have agreed to this. This is not a normal love story. This is a twisted, weird, thing that we're supposed to accept as ""normal"". That being said, I did read all 3 books just to see how it came out. So read it for the sex but don't expect it to be believable.","I had heard women buzzing all over town about this horrific dirty, naughty book that everybody should read. I guess I just must be a perv or at least been on this planet long enough to know these things exist and what it contains. I was not shocked. I was not blown away. I did get tired of the constant play by play in first person and all the adjectives she came up with. The build up was very good but when it came to the pay off.......eh. It's a good love story and it keeps you moving waiting for the next thing to happen but after this first volume. I'm good. I don't need to read anymore of them. It is a very juvenile approach. Like a teenagers diary almost.
If you are looking for explicit BDSM practices and far-out sex you've come to the wrong place. It's very mild. I wanna see the movie just to see how they are going to pull this off with the sex scenes and how to break up the monotony of all the emails they send back and forth.
I was smart to wait until this was on the dollar bin. It's an okay read if you are at the beach or in the back yard and have nothing but time to kill on a nice day. You won't come away with any deep understanding of much but it is a fair love story. I've certainly read better. It could have been condensed down A LOT. It started out as a self published book and I think it hurts it a lot. An editor should have gotten hold of it and cut the crap out to make it a more concise story.","Given what I'd heard about this book I expected it to be poorly written and salacious. I had never intended to read it for those reasons. But with the movie out this weekend, I can't walk two feet without having this book in my face. I decided I needed to read it, so I would truly know what all the fuss was about. What surprised me was how boring it was. There was no plot and the dialogue was silly. Also, with all the talk about this book, I expected it to be sexy to the point of scandalous. I didn't find it sexy at all and certainly not romantic. When all is said and done, it's not the subject matter that I find offensive. It's the bad writing.","This concept could have really worked, but it falls flat. I honestly don't know how this became a best seller. You would think the editors could have offered suggestions to improve this book. The author doesn't really seem to know her own characters very well. One moment Mr. Grey is sophisticated and worldly and then he says something that completely strays from his character. Also, it's a little far fetched that his character is a man in his 20's. This kind of character wouod be much more believable if he were older and had some life experience.

If you want real unbelievability, Ana is your girl. A 21 year old virgin that jumps into a Dom/Sub relationship right out of the gate. And is completely comfortable discussing sex (which she has no experience with) in great detail. And the constant use if oh my, jeez, the ""inner goddess"", the ""mean machine"" and the lip biting get old quickly. It's just hard to believe that someone of her age and experience level would be in a relationship like this right out of the gate.

Some of the sex scenes are well written, but again (saw someone mention this in another review), she climaxes at the drop of a hat. Give me a break. This story had potential, but I think in the end the writing needs a LOT of work. And another thing that gets annoying is the writer will grab on to a ""big"" word and use it more than once in a paragraph. For one, people don't talk like this in everyday life and it only makes her look desperaye to sound smart","sexually explicit, unsuited to age group, and other (“poorly written,” “concerns that a group of teenagers will want to try it”)"
Internet Girls (series),Lauren Myracle,young adult novel series,2005,4.3,102,33,20,11,54,"IF YOU ARE MATURE AND HAVE HAD A GOOD UPBRINGING BY YOUR PARENTS, THIS BOOK WILL NOT BE A BAD INFLUENCE ON YOU!!!!!!!!!!! I am 13. I have just finished reading this book about 30 minutes ago. I loved it. I was short, took me less than 8 hours to read (unlike some books), and amused me. I do have to warn some people though: If you do not want your child reading stuff that normal teenagers talk about, do not be offended when you or your daughter reads pages 10 & 11 or any of the others like them. I understand that some people find that kind of stuff offensive and think it is too ""mature"" for their pre-teen/young teen. This book has no plot. There isn't supposed to be one. It is a book about 3 girls who have been best friends for 4 years (Angela: the outgoing one; Maddie: the wild one; Zoe: the calm Church-goer). They Instant Message each other all throughout the book and discuss what is happening in their lives. The stuff they talk about and/or do is mostly amusing and funny, but some of it can be just the thing some moms want their children to stay away from. The friends go through every-day normal things like break-ups and grudges and even embarrassing party moments that get the whole school talking.

Even though many mothers would think that since Maddie danced topless on a table because she was drunk, that it would be a bad influence on their daughters. Well, if that influences your daughter in a bad way, it's not the book's fault. Right now, I have no desire to go to a party, get drunk off spiked Kool-Aid, and dance topless on a table while boys throw quarters at me. Most likely, neither will you or your daughter just because a book character did it. Yes, there is cussing. Yes, almost all teenagers cuss. Don't say that your teen doesn't because your teen most likely has done it when you are not around and just lies about it. Everyone I know cusses (I know A LOT of people, even if they aren't my friends) even if it's only once a month. My teachers cuss, my entire school cusses, and you probably do, too. I didn't read the reviews before buying this book (I bought it because I love the author) and I was not offended and I don't think bad about Lauren. I suggest you read the book. Some parts are nasty, I know, but sooner or later, it'll all be a part of life. If you disagree with anything I'm saying, I'm sorry, but I really don't want a bunch of angry mothers commenting that I'm a bad kid or that I hang around with bad people if everyone I know swears. Thank you.","I see a lot of parents on here saying this book is too mature for their kids. I read this book the year it came out, when I was close to the age of the protagonists and when AIM was popular. This isn’t much more “mature” than the conversations I had with my friend group at the time. Yes, there is swearing and sexual content. That’s what normal adolescent girls talk about. I don’t know how well the format and lingo of this book holds up today, but content-wise, it was enjoyable for pre-teen me. It’s very real and covers some serious topics but in a way that is geared towards tweens and teens. If you let your kids anywhere near social media there is NOTHING in this book they haven’t already seen or read about online.","Let me be honest: I picked this book up solely because it's one of the top 10 most challenge books. The style is unique. The novel is written solely in instant message format between three girls who are best friends. There's nothing particularly remarkable about the girls. One is boy crazy, sweet, and upbeat. One is shy and religious. And the other has poor self esteem and a bad attitude. Nothing these girls say is out of the ordinary or all that uncommon. So why all the controversy? I'm going to tell you, but let me first give an alert:

SPOILERS: Within the first dozen pages, the girls talk about how one of them overheard two other girls in the bathroom. One of the girls was telling the other one about how one of their supposed friends ejaculates when she orgasms. That's mostly it. That's what the main problem people have with this book. Some tiny piece of gossip that one of the main characters overheard in a high school bathroom stall. Now, there are also mentions of sausages, shlongs, etc in referring to a penis. And one (or possibly two) girls joke about how they want to get their hands on particular boy's penises using those euphemisms. But when it comes closer to being an actual reality, they all shy off of the topic. Just like your average teenage girl, they want to have sex but they're scared to death of actually doing it. The other thing that some might have a problem with is that one of the girls has a crush on a teacher. The teacher seems to have a crush on her. As this becomes more and more apparent to the girl, her crush turns into unease. The teacher invites her to go ""hottubbing"" at a house he's housesitting at and she goes. She's afraid of what might happen, but (for some reason) still goes. She's also afraid to tell the teacher she changed her mind. So her friends band together and crash it, making her feel safe and embarrassing the teacher. The other thing that happens in this book is that one girl goes to a frat party with a new friend. The new friend is a bitch and eggs her into drinking too much and dancing on a table. She dances topless while she's drunk. The bitch friend sends pictures of her through email. Yes, these girls make mistakes, but I don't see what the major deal is with this book.

Since this is a review of the book, I do want to say that this book wasn't great. It was interesting to see it in a chat message format, but the dialoge fell flat. None of the girls were witty enough to carry a full story based solely on dialoge. I won't be reading any more of these books, but there ya go.","As a librarian, I try to read reviews before ordering books to place in our high school. I was intrigued with the description of this book's format (Instant Messaging between friends). All reviews praised the book's uniqueness and its insight on the lives of three high school girls, however, this is not a book I will be putting on the shelf. The profanity throughout the book was unnecessary. I would have a difficult time justifying it to an irate parent who might complain about the explicit language. In addition to the language, the plot of the book was slow. The conflicts of each character did not fully surface until the last 40 pages of the book. I will be donating this book to our public library. It has SOME merit but it is not a battle I choose to fight with the school board if this book were ever challenged.",I got this book for a masters course on adolescent literature... let me begin by saying I would NOT recommend buying this book. The whole book is about 3 young girls having a conversation and at times is quite risque. For what is supposed to be a young adult novel some of the subject matter belongs at a college reading level... though the writing itself is that for a 6th grade audience. Terrible book! I've read many young adult novels (for career purposes) and have enjoyed most of them... this however is not the case with this book!,offensive language and sexually explicit content
The Bluest Eye,Toni Morrison,African-American literature,1970,4.6,6591,1214,599,190,253,"This book is really difficult to read if you're sensitive to themes of child sexual abuse, general child abuse, racism, and some animal abuse. Honestly, if you've been abused I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to read it for a class because it takes the perspective of the rapist during the rape scene which was really difficult for me to read personally.
HOWEVER, if you haven't experienced abuse, this is a really important book. It gives you an important and vastly underrepresented perspective on the ways systems built on racism and neglect fail children of color and allow for horrific things to happen to them, and the narration of the book is actually beautiful and very compelling. It is hard to read, it is difficult subject material, but push through it. It's a good and worthwhile book.","Toni Morrison's “The Bluest Eye” is a unique novel that is not for the lighthearted. It describes in great detail, the life of an African American child raised in tough circumstances. During a time period of depression, the protagonist is often found in the worst situations. Men are often portrayed as dirty predators, while women are portrayed more as sexual objects. Throughout the book lies a dark tone of hatred towards the protagonist and rarely shows any hope for the her. As more of the protagonist’s and her family’s past is revealed, the darker the story gets. Through the young girl she portrays the issues of self confidence when influenced by society's norms. She makes a statement that we favor society’s opinion too much, always idolizing the covergirl look. The book points out that girls chase beauty standards to a point that is volatile. The focus on beauty goes hand in hand with how women are portrayed for the time era. Morrison also attempts to display how men and women change and develop through the book’s large character set that has many opposing values.While the novel may be slow and confusing in the first chapters, the book hooks the reader with story that grabs your heart. The story is a huge tear jerker. I recommend this book to those who can enjoy a depressing book. This book is also touches on sensitive subjects, contains explicit scenes, and has very crude language, so this book is for a more mature audience.","While Toni Morrison is more than worthy of her status as a Nobel Prize Laureate for Literature, her first novel here is somewhat of a disappointment to me. The story is about an eleven year old girl, Pecola, growing up in 1941 with World War II and the end of the great depression in Morrison's hometown of Lorain, Ohio. While I applaud MOrrison's attempt to create the atmosphere by using realistic devices such as a dialogue, slang, and cruel truths of life. Pecola leads a very bleak life with a father, Cholly. The book first states that she is carrying her own father's baby. I got confused while reading this book about Cholly's role as father. I'm not quite sure what happens to Pecola. The book is disjointed at times with different narrators and not a single voice. I felt lost at times and confused by the situation around Pecola's life. While I applaud anybody who writes a novel, this book was somewhat disappointing because I still felt that MOrrison was trying to find the right voice. Regardless, Morrison does write a powerful, grim, bleak novel but I still hold hope for Pecola's life.","The writer gets a bit carried away with her own prose, But if you want to read just for the aesthetics, I guess it is a good book. I want a story that is readable not plodding and over presented, so I was not very impressed.May have been a really good story somewhere amid all the hyperbole, but lost my interest.","Wish I could give this book negative stars. Quite simply; it is pornographic, degenerate and perverted. How twisted a person’s mind has to be to first imagine and then write on paper is disturbing. The book leaves you feeling filthy. The vulgar nature of the content destroys any redeeming qualities this book might of had.
